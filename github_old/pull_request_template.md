## Firestorm Pull Request Checklist
Thank you for contributing to the Phoenix Firestorm Project.
We will endeavour to review you changes and accept/reject/request changes as soon as possible. 
Please read and follow the [Firestorm Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/firestormviewer/phoenix-firestorm/blob/master/FS_PR_GUIDELINES.md) to reduce the likelihood that we need to ask for "Bureaucratic" changes to make the code comply with our workflows.
